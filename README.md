### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**touhoumalaysia/touhoumalaysia** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: My own website.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: HTML, Java, C++, C# blah blah blah...
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: No one :)
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Setting up my repos.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything (Touhou and non-Touhou stuff)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TouhouMalaysia). 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: @theinsidersandrush is my owner. I like [Reimu Hakurei](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Reimu_Hakurei) and [Marisa Kirisame](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame) because I like main characters.
